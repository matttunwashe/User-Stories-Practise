Bad user stories
---------------
1. Customer has requested to be able to backup his hard drive.

	* As a power user, I shuld be able to indicate folders to backup so my backup doesn't become too filled up with junk files.

_the problem with this user stories is that, the sentences are too long and also it's wrong to put more than one user stories in a point. this is referred to as epic and it must be split into more points._
